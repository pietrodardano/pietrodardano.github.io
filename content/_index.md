        I'm a PhD Candidate in BMW AI Robotics Lab in collaboration TU-Eindhoven.

        My research interests lies in the field of multimodal perception and behaviour adaptation for robots interacting with human and cluttered environments.
        From the robotics based research i then distill algorithms and methods to improve in-vehicle human-machine interaction.

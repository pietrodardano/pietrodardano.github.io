## About Me

I am a PhD Candidate at the BMW AI Robotics Lab in collaboration with TU-Eindhoven. 
My research focuses on multimodal perception and behavior adaptation for robots in dynamic, cluttered environments, human-robot and human-vehicle interaction.

With a background in AI for robotics, reinforcement learning, and control engineering, I have worked on projects involving autonomous systems, robotic perception, and decision-making. My experience includes developing Force-Driven validation systems for autonomous aircraft testing, reinforcement learning for quadruped robots, and actuated platforms for drone stability testing.

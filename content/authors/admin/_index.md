#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a PhD Candidate at the BMW AI Robotics Lab in collaboration with TU-Eindhoven. 
My research focuses on multimodal perception and behavior adaptation for robots in dynamic, cluttered environments, particularly in human-robot interaction and adaptive manipulation.

With a background in AI for robotics, reinforcement learning, and control engineering, I have worked on projects involving autonomous systems, robotic perception, and decision-making. My experience includes developing tactile-driven validation systems for aircraft testing, reinforcement learning for quadruped robots, and actuated platforms for drone stability testing.

I am committed to pushing the boundaries of robotic intelligence and automation. If you're interested in collaborating, feel free to reach out! üöÄ
